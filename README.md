# project-database-management-system
It is very tedious to find and manage projects and research papers using
manual or classical processes. The main goal of this project is to build an
integrated framework to help the users find projects that suit their needs.
Project management system is a system for the management and supervision
of projects and research papers. It is a management system that is useful to
students, project managers, as well as professors.
We have used Oracle Live SQL for the implementation of this project.
